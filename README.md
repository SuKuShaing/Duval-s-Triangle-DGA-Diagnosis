# Duval-s-Triangle-DGA-Diagnosis
A canvas HTML5 project to create Duval's Triangle for 4 key Gases CH4,C2H2,C2H4 and detect the fault in transformer.
In this the user can enter the values of three key gases and the input will be ppm or in concentration. 
The Javascript file automatically map the concentration value to percentage and draw the coordinates on the triangle and finds
the intersection of those three points to finally draw out resulting dot on the duval's triangle.
